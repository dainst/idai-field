Field is a modern take on flexible field and find recording for archaeological excavations. It is developed as a cooperation between the German Archaeological Institute ([DAI](https://www.dainst.org)) and the Head Office of the GBV Common Library Network ([GBV](https://en.gbv.de/)). Field is completely Open Source and free to use!

For an overview of the genesis and the idea behind Field, check out one of our latest articles: 

S. Hohl – T. Kleinke – F. Riebschläger – J. Watson, **iDAI.field: developing software for the documentation of archaeological fieldwork**, AeC 34, 1, 2023, 85–94, doi: [10.19282/ac.34.1.2023.10](https://doi.org/10.19282/ac.34.1.2023.10).

Using Field, archaeologists can: 

* record, share and store all data and images produced on the excavation
* customize their own data model on top of a minimal shared model as defined by Field
* locate all of their records on a map
* manage types and inventories
* sync & publish their excavation data
