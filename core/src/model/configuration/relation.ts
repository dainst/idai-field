     * on the specific context, as per the categories involved. For example in the case of a Find and
     * a Feature we would use the relation to express that the Find is mostly included in that specific
     * Feature. In the case of an Inscription and a Find we would use it to express that the Find has that
     * specific inscription, which is then a specific instance of an inscription (a token, rather than a type)
     * found on a particular Find.
     * 
     * Having most of the resources of the application in such a forest allows for widely used 
     * and commonly understood hierarchical navigation, as you have it in file browsers etc.
